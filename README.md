## Background

The handbook builds on the [Data Pipeline](http://toolbox.schoolofdata.ch/overview.html) designed by the [School of Data](https://schoolofdata.org) to work with students, journalists, and the civil society. It references the [Dribdat](https://dribdat.cc) platform and other tools from the open data community ([Opendata.ch](https://opendata.ch) - Swiss chapter of Open Knowledge). The book was written for and with students of the Lucerne University of Applied Arts and Sciences ([HSLU](https://hslu.ch)).
