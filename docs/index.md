## Principles

The module and book is built around **three simple ideas:**

- That we need a structure to guide us and to which we are accountable
- That we need a cohort to spar with, a coach above us, and someone to teach
- That the most substantive form of skill improvement is the analysis of our own results

## Authors

The Data Skills module was developed and initially deployed at the [Lucerne University of Applied Arts & Sciences](https://hslu.ch).
