## What is Data Literacy? üìñ

_The ability to read, understand, create, and communicate with **data**._

Data literacy (datalit) encompasses _‚Äúthe ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data, in a critical manner‚Äù_ ([Ridsdale et al 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Data-Literacy-Competencies-Matrix-by-Ridsdale-et-al-2015-3-reduced-version_fig2_359343406)).

Much of this is already taught in grade school, as part of mathematics and science curriculum. How do you see your own datalit skills?

We generally see data literacy as a broad field with complementary skills in economics, linguistics, and more. 
    
<small>There are several models, such as the competencies matrix by [Ralph Kr√ºger](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Data-Literacy-Competencies-Matrix-by-Ridsdale-et-al-2015-3-reduced-version_fig2_359343406), which suggest how data literacy should be taught and applied. A useful mental model is the [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid), which I extended here to differentiate between "structured data" (secondary data, in science) and "raw measurements" (primary data).</small>

A good metaphor is cooking. If data is the raw ingredient and we manage to produce tasty information, then knowledge is what you gain when you consume it... Wisdom is gained through staying fit - with a healthy information diet!

_"We are increasingly reliant on data to **make decisions**."_ Open Knowledge is a global non-profit promoting a healthy, well-balanced relationship to data. They are one of many organizations you can turn to for advice on data literacy.

<small>There are many other interesting organizations deserving of mention, which support data literacy in particular areas such as [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.ch) (mapping), [Wikimedia](http://wikimedia.ch/) (open content, linked data), [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.ch/) (privacy, ethics), [ONIA](https://opennetworkinfrastructure.org/) (hardware, networks), ... </small>
