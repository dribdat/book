# Gratitude

🙇 Thank you to participants of Data Skills 2022 - 2023 for all your sustained interest and critical feedback!

🙏 Thank you Birk and all my colleagues at D+K HSLU who have opened their doors and supported the creation of this course.

🌍 Thanks to the Open Data community around the world that makes Data something we _want_ to learn, not just _have_ to learn.
