# Big on Purpose, small on data

Creating our own Data Packages is a way to express the purpose we assign to the data, connect it to the origins and context, take a step towards a new engagement of mutually caring for the data. A bit like urban gardening where people help to water and weed the plants.

[Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/) aims to solve many of the pitfalls of data reuse on the Web with set of simple standards and cross-platform tools. The [Data Package Creator](https://create.frictionlessdata.io/) quickly generates descriptive metadata (packaging) based on CSV files, which you can use with other tools.

Using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Frictionless Repository](https://repository.frictionlessdata.io/), the Data Package can be automatically validated. This allows you to use public data sources as well as your own automations reliably. You can also pick up a nice badge: [![](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/repository-demo/actions/workflows/frictionless.yaml/badge.svg)](https://repository.frictionlessdata.io/docs/badges.html)
