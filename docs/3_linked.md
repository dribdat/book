When you explore the [Linked Web of Data](https://lod-cloud.net/), you will start to get a better idea of which sources you can rely on. You will find many ways of how to connect and contribute to it.

Tools like [Wikidata Query Builder](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:AnBuKu/My_query_tinkering) make it possible to run searches and extract data without programming SPARQL. See also [CH community examples](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/event/1) for various interesting queries, and learn by example.
