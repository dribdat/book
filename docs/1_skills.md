The [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) in the UK offers "data skills courses to balance technical with non-technical skills to ensure that people can make an impact with data, and help ensure the best social and economic outcomes for everyone." We too can use their [Data Skills Framework](https://theodi.org/article/data-skills-framework/) to plan our studies.
